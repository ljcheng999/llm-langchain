Welcome to the **CRM Agent Tutorial**! This project demonstrates how to build an intelligent Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using AI agents, LangGraph, and real customer data. Meet **Tyler** - your AI-powered marketing assistant who can analyze customer behavior, create personalized marketing campaigns, and automate email communications.

## 🎯 What People'll Learn

- Build an AI agent using **LangGraph** and **OpenAI**
- Implement **human-in-the-loop** workflows for sensitive operations
- Create **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** for customer segmentation
- Design **personalized marketing campaigns** using AI
- Integrate **PostgreSQL** with AI agents for real-time data analysis
- Use **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for tool integration

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.13+** installed
- **PostgreSQL** database (we use Supabase)
- **OpenAI API key**
- **Git** for cloning the repository

## ⚡ Quick Start

Want to get started immediately? Here's the fastest path:

This project uses `uv` for dependency management. If you don't have `uv` installed, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/).

1. **Clone and setup**:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd crm-agent
   uv sync  # Install dependencies
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your OpenAI API key and Supabase URI
   ```

3. **Setup database** (create free Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)):
   - Create a new Supabase project. Use the generate_password feature to generate a secure password, copy it into the .env file for use later.
   - Copy the connection string from the Supabase project settings and paste it into the .env file (you'll see a 'connect' button at the top of the dashboard), replacing the placeholder with the actual connection string.
   - Replace the password placeholder with the password you generated earlier.
   - Copy and paste the sql from `db/migration-create-tables.sql` into the Supabase SQL editor. This will automatically create all of the db tables for you.
   - Import each CSV file from the `data` directory into the corresponding table in Supabase.

4. **Verify and run**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && uv run python3 chat_local.py  # Start chatting with Tyler!
   ```

## 🎮 Running the Application

### Start the Chat Interface

```bash
cd frontend
uv run python chat_local.py
```

## 📊 Understanding the Data

### Customer Segments (RFM Analysis)

Tyler uses RFM analysis to categorize customers:

- **🏆 Champions** (555): Best customers - high recency, frequency, and monetary value
- **🆕 Recent Customers** (5XX): Recently active customers
- **🔄 Frequent Buyers** (X5X): Customers who buy often
- **💰 Big Spenders** (XX5): High-value customers
- **⚠️ At Risk** (1XX): Haven't purchased recently
- **👥 Others**: Everyone else

### Database Schema

The project includes these main tables:

- **customers**: Customer information and contact details
- **transactions**: Purchase history and transaction data
- **items**: Product catalog with descriptions and prices
- **rfm**: Customer segmentation scores
- **marketing_campaigns**: Campaign tracking
- **campaign_emails**: Email delivery and engagement tracking

## Adding New Tools

Create new MCP tools in `src/Tyler/mymcp/servers/marketing_server.py`:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def your_new_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Your tool description."""
    # Your implementation here
    return "Tool result"
```
